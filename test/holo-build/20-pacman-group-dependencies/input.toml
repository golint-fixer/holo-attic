# This testcase checks a special feature of the --pacman generator:
# package.requires may reference a whole package group which is expanded by
# holo-build into the members of the package group.
#
# Since the testcase must be able to run without a pacman(8) binary present,
# the mock implementation for package group resolution splits the group name on
# dashes, so e.g. "group:foo-bar" resolves into packages "foo" and "bar".
