# This testcase checks that consistent indentation inside file contents is
# pruned (unless explicitly disabled with raw=true).
#
# WARNING: Be very careful when editing this file, to not have your editor
# mangle the indentation (it's sometimes with tabs, sometimes with spaces,
# sometimes both at the same time, and that's desired).
