This test checks the platform integration for RPM-based distributions.

* `/etc/targetfile-with-rpmnew.conf` has a config file and repo file with an
  existing target base, and there is also a `.rpmnew` file that the package manager
  has placed next to the config file as part of an update of the application
  package. We should recognize this file and move it into `/var/lib/holo/base`.
* `/etc/targetfile-with-rpmsave.conf` is the same basic situation, but instead
  of saving the new default config in `$TARGET_PATH.rpmnew`, RPM decided to
  overwrite the configuration file directly, and save a backup of the previous
  configuration at `$TARGET_PATH.rpmsave`. (It does that sometimes, apparently.)
