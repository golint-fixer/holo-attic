type Package struct {
	//Name is the package name.
	Name string
	//Version is the version for the package contents. While many package
	//formats are more or less liberal about the format of version strings,
	//holo-build requires versions to adhere to the Semantic Version format
	//(semver.org). Build metadata is not supported, while as an extension, we
	//support an arbitrary number of segments in the initial
	//"MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH" part.
	Version string
	//Release is a counter that can be increased when the same version of one
	//hologram needs to be rebuilt. The default value is 1.
	Release uint
	//Epoch is a counter that can be increased when the version of a newer
	//package is smaller than the previous version, thus breaking normal
	//version comparison logic. This is usually only necessary when changing to
	//a different version numbering scheme. The default value is 0, which
	//usually results in the epoch not being shown in the combined version
	//string at all.
	Epoch uint
	//Description is the optional package description.

	//for this package and thus must be installed together with this package.
