//This program is used by the holo-build tests to extract generated packages and render
//a textual representation of the package, including the compression and
//archive formats used and all file metadata contained within the archives.
//The program is called like
//
//    ./build/dump-package < $package
//
//And renders output like this:
//
//    $ tar cJf foo.tar.xz foo/
//    $ ./build/dump-package < foo.tar.xz
//    XZ-compressed data
//        POSIX tar archive
//            >> foo/ is directory (mode: 0755, owner: 1000, group: 1000)
//            >> foo/bar is regular file (mode: 0600, owner: 1000, group: 1000), content: data as shown below
//                Hello World!
//            >> foo/baz is symlink to bar
//
//The program is deliberately written very generically so as to make it easy to
//add support for new package formats in the future (when holo-build gains new
//generators).
